# 📺 Hand Gesture Recognition for Smart TVs  

This project introduces a **gesture-based control system** for smart TVs, eliminating the need for a remote. Using a webcam, the system continuously monitors user gestures to execute various commands seamlessly.  

## 🚀 Features  
The model recognizes **five key gestures**, each mapped to a specific TV control action:  

- 👍 **Thumbs Up** → Increase volume  
- 👎 **Thumbs Down** → Decrease volume  
- 👈 **Left Swipe** → Jump backward 10 seconds  
- 👉 **Right Swipe** → Jump forward 10 seconds  
- ✋ **Stop** → Pause the movie  

## 🎯 Objective  
Enhancing the **user experience** by providing an **intuitive, touch-free** way to control smart TVs, making entertainment more immersive and accessible.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Computer Vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe)  
- Deep Learning (CNN, TensorFlow)  
- Python for implementation  

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Adding more gestures for advanced controls  
- Improving accuracy with real-time gesture tracking  
- Integrating with voice commands for hybrid control
